= Architecture

For the next time I pick this project back up.
How does it work, what does each piece do, what's the overall flow.

There's currently ongoing design decisions, ideas, changes, etc., that exist only in my head.
That's a problem.


== Overview
=== The flow
==== Parsing

The first "block" takes in an absolute file path, and outputs a File object represented as a tuple of `{AST, Symtab}`.

----
     path
      |
  [ LEXER ] >> tokens
                  |
              [ PARSER ] >> AST
                             |
                         [ SYMTAB ] >> {AST, Symtab}
----

This is referred to as "parsing a file".

The file objects are stored in an associative array: `FILES[absolute_path] = {AST, Symtab}`.

==== Fold & merge

=== Symbol table creation phase
== Tree walk phases
=== Fold/merge phase
=== Flattening phase
== Linear phases
=== Typechecking phase
=== Evaluation phase
== Dismiss army of the dead phase
== Pre-processor
