         - Easier to merge
   5. [ ] New `merge` that respects new import rules
   6. [x] Includes use `as`, enter the identifier into the symtab

   Revert types to use a linked list again. It's easier in bash to reason about
   as there are fewer namerefs, and empty arrays and whatnot. More
   introspect-able, as some _TYPE_NUM's are not being used for the arrays, etc.
   
   Need this change to be reflected in the...
   - [x] parser
   - [ ] symtab   phase
   - [ ] merge    phase
   - [ ] semantic phase
   - [ ] compiler phase
