Still needs:

parser
   include / constrain statements
   empty arrays
   arrays of arrays
   pratt parsing
      - all expressions
      - operator precedence
      - string concatenation & typecasting
      - unary & typecasting

conflang
   (add an `if __name__ == '__main__'` so can source without executing)
   merge includes
   constraints
      only read the lowest existing file
      required keys if no default
      can overwrite value
      can't overwrite type
