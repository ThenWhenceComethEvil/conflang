Still needs:

lexer & parser
   didn't accidentally use a p_ in the lexer, or l_ in the parser

parser
   exceptions
   error tokens
   error recovery
   include / constrain statements

conflang
   (add an `if __name__ == '__main__'` so can source without executing)
   merge includes
   constraints
      only read the lowest existing file
      required keys if no default
      can overwrite value
      can't overwrite type
