   Fixed tests, resolved a couple more bugs recently. Putting this project back
   down for a little while.

   I still very much believe the fundamental philosophy is sound. A
   configuration file should be responsible for its own typechecking and
   validation.

   A stupidly simple, yet extensible, DSL can handle validation or added
   functionality.
