= ideas.

As ideas come up, they're documented here.
Maybe to implement later.
Maybe not.

== AWK pre-processor
=== Topics
Add in "subscribe" statements, to enable specific debugging information.
E.g.,

[source,bash]
----
function type:new {
   #<<TOPIC TYPES
   printf "[%8s] Created type: ${type_r[kind]}, with subtypes:\n"
   printf "%15s- %s\n" "${subtype_r[kind]}"
   printf "\n"
   #>>TOPIC
}
----

Then if you pre-process with:  CONFC_SUBSCRIBE='TYPES' awk -f build.awk src/*
it enables all of the `TYPES` topics, while ignoring the rest of them.

Can subscribe to multiple by comma delimiting:  CONF_SUBSCRIBE='TYPES,FILES,DEBUG'

Helps for a bit more targeted debugging information.

=== Enable "dot" syntax
Largely completed already in the draft of `shmacros`.
Should be trivial to port into the existing pre-processor.


== Bash pre-processor
The AWK version is linewise, and very limited.

Want to learn to write a "`real`" pre-processor, operating on Tokens instead of regex'ing lines.
